What top three factors will be most important in making your decision on what company to start your career off with and why is each one important (i.e. location, work content, family, friends, compensation, career path, work culture, etcâ€¦)?
- The top three factors for me making my decision will be:
    1. Inclusivity in the work culture. In a team setting, I would like my ideas heard. Especially as a minority (Asian American woman) in Computer Science, I would like to be respected while having fun collaborating with my coworkers on problem solving.
    2. Access to mentoring and clear career growth. I care deeply about learning from technical mentors and would like to be part of an internship that challenges me while giving me oppotunities to learn both hands-on and from other experienced professionals.
    3. Compensation. I'd like to be offered a fair package for the talent and engineering I bring to the company.

When are you expected to graduate?
- I expect to graduate with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science (with an Applied Focus in Artificial Intelligence) in Spring 2023.

Have you accepted any offers from Microsoft or another company?
- No, I have not yet accepted any offers.
