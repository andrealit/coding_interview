What top three factors will be most important in making your decision on what company to start your career off with and why is each one important (i.e. location, work content, family, friends, compensation, career path, work culture, etcâ€¦)?
- The top three factors for me making my decision will be:
    1. Inclusivity in the work culture. In a team setting, I would like my ideas heard. Especially as a minority (Asian American woman) in Computer Science, I would like to be respected while having fun collaborating with my coworkers on problem-solving.
    2. Opportunity to meet and interact with software engineering, AI, and ML professionals for future Microsoft projects. I care deeply about acquiring new skills and want to be part of an internship that challenges me. During the internship and beyond, my goal is to contribute to quality solutions for my team.
    3. Compensation. I want to be offered a fair package for the talent, new perspective, and engineering skills I bring to the company.

When are you expected to graduate?
- I expect to graduate with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science in Spring 2023. My focus area is AI and ML. 

Have you accepted any offers from Microsoft or another company?
- No, I have not yet accepted any offers.
